This demonstrates my styling problem with programmatically created components.

The app.component.html file has three of my button components.  As you can see, these components are being styled correctly.

However, when you click the buttons to show the modals, you'll see that the buttons do not style correctly.

I have the console logging something when a button is instantiated, so you can see that the factory creates the ApkButtonComponents that appear in the modals.

I can't figure out why the styling doesn't work.  Any help would be appreciated!
